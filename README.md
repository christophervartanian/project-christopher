#### Project Description

My project is meant to be similar to Apple's Weather App. We plan to be able to show actual and predicted temperatures and precipitation for a given date or date range. Currently we are only using data for Honolulu, HI.

#### What user stories were completed this iteration?

In this iteration I am focused on improving functionality. I completed:
* Allowing the user to see a summary of the temperature and precipitation averages for any range of dates
* Allowed the user to see a breakdown of the description of the weather for their chosen range (i.e. Hot, Cold, Light Rain, Heavy Rain)



#### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
After cloning and entering the repository on the command line, run the following commands:
* ./RunTemp.sh
